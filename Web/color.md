Tints, tones, and shades are terms being used when talking about color.

A “tint” is the mixture of a color with white.If I drag this slider to the left I’m basically adding white, therefore lightening the color.

On the opposite scale, a “shade” is the mixture of a color with black.So if I drag my slider down I’m basically adding black to that color and creating a more darker color.


Now, a “tone” is the mixture of a color with both black and white, so if I drag the slider here diagonally I’m adding both black and white at the same time.

Now, here’s a quick look at an RGB based color wheel. Tints are when you add white.Tones are when you add gray. And shades is when you add black to a color. I’m Adi Purdila, thanks for watching “Tints, tones, and shades in 60 seconds”.

The colors you choose in your designs can give the illusion of depth, making important things seem closer to the viewer and more likely to catch the eye. Learn how to use color for attention and depth in sixty seconds.

`Generally speaking, something closer to the eye seems brighter or more vivid, while something further away seems darker or more subdued. You can use this in your designs to create clear points of focus so the visitor knows where to look right away.`


Start by deciding what you want your visitors to pay most attention to and then give that thing a nice vivid color.

This you can change to

 Surrounding elements can still be colorful, just make sure that they're not as bright as your main point of focus.

Now add gradual changes in color brightness and saturation, to add layers of depth pushing important things forward,

 while less important things get pushed further back. That's how you can use color to control attention and add depth in 60 seconds.
