## 1. [Tints, Tones and Shades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5TXHIXsgO4&list=PLgGbWId6zgaVkI3H31w_avkotSZCM3D9Y)

Tints, tones, and shades are terms being used when talking about color.

A “tint” is the mixture of a color with white.If I drag this slider to the left I’m basically adding white, therefore lightening the color.

On the opposite scale, a “shade” is the mixture of a color with black.So if I drag my slider down I’m basically adding black to that color and creating a more darker color.


Now, a “tone” is the mixture of a color with both black and white, so if I drag the slider here diagonally I’m adding both black and white at the same time.

Now, here’s a quick look at an RGB based color wheel. Tints are when you add white.Tones are when you add gray. And shades is when you add black to a color. I’m Adi Purdila, thanks for watching “Tints, tones, and shades in 60 seconds”.


## 2. [Color for Attention and Depth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kno4couGkNo&list=PLgGbWId6zgaVkI3H31w_avkotSZCM3D9Y&index=6)



The colors you choose in your designs can give the illusion of depth, making important things seem closer to the viewer and more likely to catch the eye. Learn how to use color for attention and depth in sixty seconds.

`Generally speaking, something closer to the eye seems brighter or more vivid, while something further away seems darker or more subdued. You can use this in your designs to create clear points of focus so the visitor knows where to look right away.`


Start by deciding what you want your visitors to pay most attention to and then give that thing a nice vivid color.

This you can change to

 Surrounding elements can still be colorful, just make sure that they're not as bright as your main point of focus.

Now add gradual changes in color brightness and saturation, to add layers of depth pushing important things forward,

 while less important things get pushed further back. That's how you can use color to control attention and add depth in 60 seconds.

## 3. [Analogous Colors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny35CtVMlMI&list=PLgGbWId6zgaVkI3H31w_avkotSZCM3D9Y&index=7)

Analogous colors sit next to each other on the color wheel. If we rotate this around the wheel, we will see some great color schemes and these are often found in nature.

nature. There are harmonious, comfortable and pleasing to the eyes. For web design it’s recommended you use a maximum of three colors. The rest should be neutral, otherwise you risk over-complicating your composition.

Please note that analogous colors lack contrast, so the scheme you'll be creating won't be as vibrant as a complementary one. For example, this ad uses a complementary color scheme. Now here's the same ad, but with an analogous color scheme. See how the call to action stands out more on the complementary one?

So to wrap things up if you're looking for a harmonious and pleasing color scheme go for analogous. I'm Adi Purdila, thanks for watching.



## 4. [Complementary Colors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwNp-5BY_9s&list=PLgGbWId6zgaVkI3H31w_avkotSZCM3D9Y&index=11)

Complementary colors refer to a pair of colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel. Here is a very simple example:
![](img/complementory/complementory%201.png)

Red and green, or blue and orange, or this one. So, we pick one hue and then its opposite from the other side of the spectrum. Now, most of the time you'll want to use either a tint or a shade because the pure color is too vibrant and can produce unwanted effects. 
For example this uses a pair of red and green but it's too heavy on the eyes.

 Instead you could do this, just by using tints and varying the color proportion.

Same goes for this. Here's before and after. Or this, before and after. So be very careful how you use complementary colors because they have very high contrast. I'm Adi Purdila, thanks for watching.
