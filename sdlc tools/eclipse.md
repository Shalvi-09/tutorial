`Ctrl + Shift + L`

##### `CTRL + E` Shows all open editors

##### ` CTRL + T` open all Types
##### ` CTRL + R` Open all resource files like 
##### ` CTRL + 1` Probabily the most use full commands,

Probably the most useful one. It activates the quick fix. Imagine you create a class which implements some interface. You will get an error because the inherited methods are not yet implemented. While you are on the line of code where the error occurs, press this combination to activate the quick fix. Now, select the "Add unimplemented methods" option. You can use the quick fix at every error you ever receive.

This quick fix comes in handy in other situations too. My favorite is the "Split variable declaration." Sometimes I need to broaden the scope of a variable. I activate the quick fix, split declaration, and use alt + arrow to put it where it belongs. You can find even more uses: convert a local variable to a field, rename something in a file, create inline local variables, etc.

You could use the "Split variable declaration" on the bar variable, and then move it with Alt+Arrows above the try block.

Or you could use the "Add unimplemented methods" fix here.

The best thing you can do if you see an error is to use the quick fix.
##### ` CTRL + SHIFT + O` Organize imports
##### ` ALT + Left/Right Arrow`
Move to the last location you edited. Imagine you just created a class "Foo," and now you are working on a class "Boo." Now, if you need to look at the "Foo" class, just press Alt+Left Arrow. Alt+Right Arrow brings you back to "Boo."

##### `ALT + Up/Down Arrow` 
Move the row (or the entire selection) up or down. This is very useful when rearranging code. You can even select more rows and move them all at once. Notice that it will be always correctly indented.

##### `CTRL + D` 
Delete row. Try it! You no longer need to grab the mouse and select the line, or select Home, Shift + End, Delete. Quick and clean.

##### `Alt + Shift + S` Opens Source tag
